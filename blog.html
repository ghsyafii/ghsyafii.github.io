What if I use a br tag instead of p tags?

Let's try it out lah. I think it will work? Anyway. Let's make the next 3 days matter. Glad I've got the house all to myself. The first thing on the list: cleaning up my house.

You've got to use two brs. Oh well. Still better than p tags, though. Don't like having a tag at the end of my cursor.

Man, I really should go to bed. It's damn late. I'm seriously thinking about using blot.im. But honestly, why? I don't want anybody to read my stuff. At least not yet. But there's something about putting something up on the internet. That it's <em>out there</em>, you know? Anyway, let's go to bed.

I can pretty much just write here! Looks super raw, but works in a pinch. Let's see what's up.

Another post here. What if I just write here? Guess it works. And it's free. So yeah. I'm going to use this as my blog.
Fuss-free to the max. Zero bells and whistles. If I find it too cluttered, I'll try and switch to blot.im. It's great
but I wish there was a way to try it out before subscribing. Anyway. This is pretty cool.

Just want to see what it's like.
