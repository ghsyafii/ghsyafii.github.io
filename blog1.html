<h3>const NFTs == "bullshit";</h3>
Blockchain is a digital list of transactions that is uneditable and publicly accessible. An NFT is a unique entry in that digital list. That entry contains data like who owns it and, in the case of art NFTs, a url to download the art work. 
<br><br>
If you want to buy an NFT, you must first create a digital wallet and fill it with cryptocurrency bought with actual money. When you buy an NFT, your digital wallet becomes associated with the NFT.

What if I use a br tag instead of p tags? 
<br><br>
Let's try it out lah. I think it will work? Anyway. Let's make the next 3 days matter. Glad I've got the house all to myself. The first thing on the list: cleaning up my house.
<br><br>
You've got to use two brs. Oh well. Still better than p tags, though. Don't like having a tag at the end of my cursor.

Man, I really should go to bed. It's damn late. I'm seriously thinking about using blot.im. But honestly, why? I don't want anybody to read my stuff. At least not yet. But there's something about putting something up on the internet. That it's <em>out there</em>, you know? Anyway, let's go to bed.

I can pretty much just write here! Looks super raw, but works in a pinch. Let's see what's up.

Another post here. What if I just write here? Guess it works. And it's free. So yeah. I'm going to use this as my blog.
Fuss-free to the max. Zero bells and whistles. If I find it too cluttered, I'll try and switch to blot.im. It's great
but I wish there was a way to try it out before subscribing. Anyway. This is pretty cool.
