# NFTs === "bullshit"
A blockchain is a digital list of transactions that is uneditable and publicly accessible. An NFT is a unique entry in that digital list. 

If you want to buy an NFT, you must first create a digital wallet and fill it with cryptocurrency bought with actual money. After paying, the NFT you just bought will have the following data: 

* the current digital wallet associated with it (yours, in this case)
* past digital wallets associated with it
* how much it was sold for
* dateTime information
* a url that hosts the digital asset, which is usually a media file like a .jpeg or .gif

### Draft Ideas

When you buy an NFT, you're buying a web link. No actual ownership or control of the artwork is transferred to you.

Greater fool theory

Provenance, chain of transmission. This can be gamed - a single person can own multiple wallets and "buy" and "sell" his own NFTs. A person can also ask his friends to buy his NFTs and pay them back in real money. To outsiders, it can seem that an NFT is rising in value. This is also what happens in the high-end art market - but at least you get to own something tangible and that you can enjoy without having to turn on your computer. 

The person doesn't actually buy the art work, but only an _association_ with a url that hosts the digital asset. Anybody can access the url - the only special claim you have over the url is that you have a token 

People are paying to pretend that they own a link.

Unregulated - so owning an NFT doesn't mean anything.


This means that: anybody can download the asset if he has the url, the url might go down, multiple NFTs might point to the same url and there's nothing to guarantee that your NFT is the _real_ one. 

What about using the NFT with the earliest date as an indication of the real one? Can the url be changed?

This isn't a takedown of blockchain technology or NFTs as such, but its specific application in the digital art market. I also have nothing against artists making money as such - only with them using NFTs as a means.

The bored ape series hosts some of the most expensive NFTs, with the cheapest going for a quarter million. The series was created by a dude with links to one of the biggest talent agencies in the world, CAA. CAA talents like Jimmy Fallon have been pimping their NFTs (which were probably given to them for free) at their master's behest. The hope is that fools will fall for the hype.

Means of making money.

Make people feel like they're part of a club. (Bored ape yacht club)

The real aim of NFTs is to drive demand for cryptocurrencies.

### Research

"An NFT only proves ownership of the token - not copyrights of the image. Also, it proves ownership by an address - not by a person."

"If you’re buying an NFT and it’s not explicitly stated or agreed upon, you should assume you’re not getting the rights to anything except that digital signature."

"If the NFT doesn’t grant you the legal rights over the original, what prevents the artist from tokenizing their artwork on multiple blockchains, hoping to hedge against one chain falling from grace in future? How do buyers protect themselves from that possibility? Moreover, how would a buyer even know for sure they’re buying the first or only tokenized version of the artwork?"

"What does it mean to buy an NFT of a tweet? Do you own the words used? What happens if and when the tweet is deleted or Twitter is replaced with some other platform in future?"

"Like a painting, NFTs need to be maintained. If a buyer purchases an NFT that relies on IPFS, it’ll ultimately be on them to ensure the file continues to be hosted and available to the system. If the NFT relies on a traditional URL, then buyers would be in a more precarious position, having to hope that whatever third party currently hosts the file — often the auction site, like with Grimes’ NFT — stays online.

So there’s a very real chance that, some years from now, an NFT will point to a missing file. If that’s the case, how do you prove what it is you actually own?"

“Your certificate of authenticity isn’t a certificate as much as a link to a record of your purchase. If the server the links points at goes down, your proof of ownership disappears and you won’t be getting it back.”

# The Left/Right Political Dichotomoy Has Got to Go

What does it mean for someone to be left or right of the political spectrum? In the US at least, the former means that the person is a Progressive while the latter is a Conservative. The Progressive thinks the status quo is bad and wants society to _progress_ by making changes to the political order, while the Conservative thinks things are fine as they are and wants to _conserve_ the current state of affairs. Those on the far left wants things to change immediately while those on the far right wants things to remain exactly as they are. 

### Draft Ideas

The left/right dichotomy only has meaning in relation to a particular sociopolitical context, which varies across space and time. A conservative in the US doesn't want the same things as a conservative in Afghanistan. But a conservative in the US in 2022 might also not want the same things as a conservative in 1922.

Promotes tribalism

Fuzzy term that isn't useful in political discourse
