# On NFTs
Blockchain is a digital list of transactions that is uneditable and publicly accessible. An NFT is a unique entry in that digital list. What sort of data does an NFT store? Weâ€™ll get back to that in a minute.

If you want to buy an NFT, you must first create a digital wallet and fill it with cryptocurrency bought with actual money. After paying, the NFT you just bought will have the following data: 

* the current digital wallet associated with it (yours, in this case)
* past digital wallets associated with it
* how much it was sold for
* a url to download the digital asset, such as a jpeg or gif
