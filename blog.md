# On NFTs
Blockchain is a digital list of transactions that is uneditable and publicly accessible. An NFT is a unique entry in that digital list. What sort of data does an NFT store? Weâ€™ll get back to that in a minute.

If you want to buy an NFT, you must first create a digital wallet and fill it with cryptocurrency bought with actual money. After paying, the NFT you just bought will have the following data: 

* the current digital wallet associated with it (yours, in this case)
* past digital wallets associated with it
* how much it was sold for
* a url to download the digital asset, such as a jpeg or gif

## Notes

Provenance, chain of transmission. This can be gamed - a single person can own multiple wallets and "buy" and "sell" his own NFTs. A person can also ask his friends to buy his NFTs and pay them back in real money. To outsiders, it can seem that an NFT is rising in value.

The person doesn't actually buy the art work, but only an association with a digital entry that _points_ to a url that hosts the digital asset. This means that: anybody can download the asset if he has the url, the url might go down, multiple NFTs might point to the same url and there's nothing to guarantee that your NFT is the _real_ one.
