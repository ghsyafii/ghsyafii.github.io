# On NFTs
Blockchain is a digital list of transactions that is uneditable and publicly accessible. An NFT is a unique entry in that digital list. What sort of data does an NFT store? We’ll get back to that in a minute.

If you want to buy an NFT, you must first create a digital wallet and fill it with cryptocurrency bought with actual money. After paying, the NFT you just bought will have the following data: 

* the current digital wallet associated with it (yours, in this case)
* past digital wallets associated with it
* how much it was sold for
* a url to download the digital asset, such as a jpeg or gif

## Draft Ideas

When you buy an NFT, you're buying a web link. No actual ownership or control of the artwork is transferred to you.

Greater fool theory

Provenance, chain of transmission. This can be gamed - a single person can own multiple wallets and "buy" and "sell" his own NFTs. A person can also ask his friends to buy his NFTs and pay them back in real money. To outsiders, it can seem that an NFT is rising in value.

The person doesn't actually buy the art work, but only an association with a digital entry that _points_ to a url that hosts the digital asset. This means that: anybody can download the asset if he has the url, the url might go down, multiple NFTs might point to the same url and there's nothing to guarantee that your NFT is the _real_ one. 

What about using the NFT with the earliest date as an indicated of the real one? Can the url be changed?

## Research

"An NFT only proves ownership of the token - not copyrights of the image. Also, it proves ownership by an address - not by a person."

"If you’re buying an NFT and it’s not explicitly stated or agreed upon, you should assume you’re not getting the rights to anything except that digital signature."

"If the NFT doesn’t grant you the legal rights over the original, what prevents the artist from tokenizing their artwork on multiple blockchains, hoping to hedge against one chain falling from grace in future? How do buyers protect themselves from that possibility? Moreover, how would a buyer even know for sure they’re buying the first or only tokenized version of the artwork?"

"What does it mean to buy an NFT of a tweet? Do you own the words used? What happens if and when the tweet is deleted or Twitter is replaced with some other platform in future?"

"Like a painting, NFTs need to be maintained. If a buyer purchases an NFT that relies on IPFS, it’ll ultimately be on them to ensure the file continues to be hosted and available to the system. If the NFT relies on a traditional URL, then buyers would be in a more precarious position, having to hope that whatever third party currently hosts the file — often the auction site, like with Grimes’ NFT — stays online.

So there’s a very real chance that, some years from now, an NFT will point to a missing file. If that’s the case, how do you prove what it is you actually own?"
