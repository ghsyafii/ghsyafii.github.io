# NFTs === "bullshit"
A blockchain is a digital list of transactions that is publicly accessible. An NFT is a unique entry in that digital list. 

If you want to buy an NFT, you must first create a digital wallet and fill it with cryptocurrency bought with actual money. After paying, the NFT you just bought will include the following data: 

* the current digital wallet associated with it (yours, in this case)
* past digital wallets associated with it
* how much it was sold for
* dateTime information
* a url that hosts the digital asset, which is usually a media file like a .jpeg or .gif

Since every transaction is recorded, the _provenance_ and _price history_ of a given token can be easily established - useful information for someone interested in buying art.

### Draft Ideas

When you buy an NFT, you're buying a web link. No actual ownership or control of the artwork is transferred to you.

Greater fool theory

Provenance, chain of transmission. This can be gamed - a single person can own multiple wallets and "buy" and "sell" his own NFTs. A person can also ask his friends to buy his NFTs and pay them back in real money. To outsiders, it can seem that an NFT is rising in value. This is also what happens in the high-end art market - but at least you get to own something tangible and that you can enjoy without having to turn on your computer. 

The person doesn't actually buy the art work, but only an _association_ with a url that hosts the digital asset. Anybody can access the url - the only special claim you have over the url is that you have a token 

People are paying to pretend that they own a link.

Unregulated - so owning an NFT doesn't mean anything.


This means that: anybody can download the asset if he has the url, the url might go down, multiple NFTs might point to the same url and there's nothing to guarantee that your NFT is the _real_ one. 

What about using the NFT with the earliest date as an indication of the real one? Can the url be changed?

This isn't a takedown of blockchain technology or NFTs as such, but its specific application in the digital art market. I also have nothing against artists making money as such - only with them using NFTs as a means.

The bored ape series hosts some of the most expensive NFTs, with the cheapest going for a quarter million. The series was created by a dude with links to one of the biggest talent agencies in the world, CAA. CAA talents like Jimmy Fallon have been pimping their NFTs (which were probably given to them for free) at their master's behest. The hope is that fools will fall for the hype.

Means of making money.

Make people feel like they're part of a club. (Bored ape yacht club)

The real aim of NFTs is to drive demand for cryptocurrencies.

### Research

"An NFT only proves ownership of the token - not copyrights of the image. Also, it proves ownership by an address - not by a person."

"If you’re buying an NFT and it’s not explicitly stated or agreed upon, you should assume you’re not getting the rights to anything except that digital signature."

"If the NFT doesn’t grant you the legal rights over the original, what prevents the artist from tokenizing their artwork on multiple blockchains, hoping to hedge against one chain falling from grace in future? How do buyers protect themselves from that possibility? Moreover, how would a buyer even know for sure they’re buying the first or only tokenized version of the artwork?"

"What does it mean to buy an NFT of a tweet? Do you own the words used? What happens if and when the tweet is deleted or Twitter is replaced with some other platform in future?"

"Like a painting, NFTs need to be maintained. If a buyer purchases an NFT that relies on IPFS, it’ll ultimately be on them to ensure the file continues to be hosted and available to the system. If the NFT relies on a traditional URL, then buyers would be in a more precarious position, having to hope that whatever third party currently hosts the file — often the auction site, like with Grimes’ NFT — stays online.

So there’s a very real chance that, some years from now, an NFT will point to a missing file. If that’s the case, how do you prove what it is you actually own?"

“Your certificate of authenticity isn’t a certificate as much as a link to a record of your purchase. If the server the links points at goes down, your proof of ownership disappears and you won’t be getting it back.”

"Here are some more qualities that make a work of art valuable: it is “representative” (it looks like—and was executed in the same era as—other valuable works by the same artist); it has “a good provenance” (important people have owned it before); it is “included in the literature” (critics or historians have written about it in a museum catalogue or book published by a university press). Adolph Gottlieb paintings should have sun-discs in them. Cy Twomblys are best with squiggles. When it comes to Ellsworth Kelly, the more “totemic” the better."

"Once a client has decided to consign with Sotheby’s, the work is shipped to Sotheby’s at the client’s expense. Contracted conservators inspect the art under black light and prepare a report that details any damage or past restoration. Cataloguers perform “due diligence,” which entails securing the work’s certificate of authenticity (if the artist is alive, from his gallery; if dead, from his foundation), checking the Art Loss Register (an international database of missing art) to make sure the work hasn’t been flagged as stolen, and completing a High Value Lot review if the work is estimated at over $10 million. Once the full provenance is confirmed, the work is photographed, written about, and reproduced in the catalogue."

# The Left/Right Political Dichotomoy Has Got to Go

What does it mean for someone to be left or right of the political spectrum? In the US at least, the terms are synonyms for Progressive and Conservative, respectively. The Progressive thinks Tradition is bad and wants society to _progress_ beyond it, while the Conservative thinks Tradition is good and wants to _conserve_ it. Those on the far left want Tradition to be abandoned entirely, while those on the far right want Tradition to be adopted as it is without modifications. 

### Draft Ideas

The left/right dichotomy only has meaning in relation to a particular sociopolitical context. A conservative in the US doesn't want the same things as a conservative in Afghanistan, and a conservative in the US in 2022 might also not want the same things as a conservative in 1922. 

The point is, the terms left and right only have meaning in relation to a Tradition. Since the latter differs across space and time, and doesn't have a clear sense, why use these terms?

There is also another aspect - speed. The left has been associated with immediate change, while the right with gradual change.

Promotes tribalism 

Fuzzy term that impedes constructive dialogue

# Scientific Writing Must Be Stripped of Pathos

Aristotle believed that there were three parts to persuasive writing or speaking: ethos, pathos and logos. Logos is the intellectual substance of what's being said - the validity of the arguments being made, the data supporting the premises, etc. Pathos is the emotional impact of the writing - a compelling story and a beautiful writing style can lull the reader into overlooking the logical flaws of a piece of writing. Ethos is the trustworthiness of the person trying to persuade you, which can be based on the person's credentials (you're more likely to listen to a person with a "dr." before her name when it comes to medical advice), among other things. 

### Notes

In matters where we have no expertise, we rely on Pathos. 

We do all kinds of things with words: scold, enquire, exalt, belittle, joke, provoke, describe. Sometimes, we use words to persuade. 

I need a name to describe a particular kind of writing - the sort that's used in academic writing, philosophical essays, policy papers, etc. 

There is a place for pathos in writing. But it should be jettisoned from the above cases.

After establishing the removal of pathos-cultivating techniques, I go a step further and propose a kind of writing made up of clearly indicated premises and conclusions, so that the truth value of the individual premises and the validity of the arguments made can be more readily determined.
